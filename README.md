# 259-tidying-automation-homework

For this homework assignment, you will need to use git/GitHub. First, you should fork this repository to create your own copy. Clone your copy to work on it on your own local computer or to RStudio Cloud using the instructions we went over in class.

As you work on the homework, make commits and push your changes to GitHub. When you are done with the assignment, make sure that your repository is public and submit the link to your GitHub repository on Canvas in the textbook (where you had been writing "Finished").

Since this is the first assignment where you are creating your own RStudio project (rather than working in one I created on RStudio Cloud), I included the line "install.packages("tidyverse")" so that you can install the tidyverse package. If it's already installed, you can delete or comment out that line. No other packages are needed for this homework.
